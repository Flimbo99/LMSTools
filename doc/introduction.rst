Introduction
============

LMSTools is a python library for interacting with a Logitech Media Server.

This code was inspired by the `PyLMS library by JingleManSweep \
<https://github.com/jinglemansweep/PyLMS>`_` and has sought \
to recreate a lot of the functionality that was provided by that library. The \
main difference is that the PyLMS library used the server's telnet interface \
whereas LMSTools uses the JSON interface.

LMSTools also includes additional functionality: an asynchronous callback \
server and the ability to generate player menus.
