Installation
============

The project is not currently on PyPi so you need to install the library \
manually.

Manual installation
-------------------

Download the zip file from github (it's recommended you stick to the master \
branch unless you want to test new features).

Unzip the file and copy the LMSTools folder to your project folder or, \
if you want to use it in multiple projects, copt it to a folder in your \
python path.

.. NOTE::

    Once the code reaches a stable enough level I will submit to PyPi.

    This process can be accelerated by submitting bug reports whenever \
    encountered.
